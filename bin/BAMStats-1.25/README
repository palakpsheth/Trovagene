# README

BAMStats is a tool for extracting coverage, and other data, from BAM format 
mapping files, and generating descriptive statistics of that data.


# Installation
Unpack zip archive to a convenient location. Zip archive contains two 
executables and a lib directory containing third-party jar files used by 
BAMStats. Ensure lib directory remains with executables.


#Â Running BAMstats
To run BAMStats, use the following command (in this example 4GB is allocated 
with the -Xmx flag):

java -jar -Xmx4g BAMStats-GUI-1.25.jar 

To run the command-line version of BAMStats use the following command:

java -jar -Xmx4g BAMStats-1.25.jar -i <BAM file>

For a full list of command line options: java -jar BAMStats-1.20.jar -h


# Notes 
1. BAMStats typically requires 2 to 6 GB of computer memory allocated to it (as
   a Java program, this is achieved with the -Xmx flag when running the program 
   from the command line).

3. BAMStats will except either SAM or BAM formatted files but these must be 
   sorted.
